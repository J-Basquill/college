/**
 * This program will demonstrate how to create objects of the class Circle
 * 
 * In General you need a line of code:
 * 
 * Circle circle1; // declare a variable, capable of storing a reference to a circle object.
 * 
 * circle1 = new Circle(5,7); // create a circle object using the contructor and assign its reference to circle1
 * 
 * In the example below we have instead of a single Circle reference variable, we have created
 * in memory an array of Circle references: 
 * 
 * Circle[] myCircles = new Circle[10];
 * 
 * We must then create an object for each and every element in the array of Circle called myCircles.
 * If after we declare a Circle array, we try to print the elements we will get null values for each element.
 * If we try and erroneously access a method on any of these elements we will get a null
 * pointer exception. (Try this out for yourself)
 * For each element in the array of Circle references we need to do the following:
 * 
 * myCircles[0] = new Circles(5,6); // Create a concrete object and store its reference in myCircles[0]
 * myCircles[1] = new Circles(7,8); // Create a concrete object and store its reference in myCircles[1]
 * myCircles[2] = new Circles(4,3); // Create a concrete object and store its reference in myCircles[2]
 * and so on...
 * 
 * It is only after we have created a Circle object using one of the class constructors (new Circle (5,6) )
 * and assigning the link reference of this to the array element that we can then access the getX and getY 
 * on the newly created concrete circle object methods on it.
