
/**
 * The class MethodTestBasicCircle is used to illustrate what happens when you pass 
 * an object reference to a method and use this reference to access the attributes 
 * of the object using the setter methods.
 * The main method in MethodTestBasicCircle does the following in sequence:
 * 1) creates a BasicCircle object with a radius of 10
 * 2) prints the radius of this object by passing a reference to this object to a method printCircleContents
 * and allow this method to access the objects's radius attribute using the reference passed to it.
 * 3) changes the value in the radius attribute of the object by calling the method changeCircleContents
 * passing it the reference to the object. changeCircleContents uses this reference to make and object method
 * call to set the radius of the object to the value store in a second parameter.
 * 4) repeat step 2) to prove that the objects data attribute has changed due to a call of the method changeCircleContents.
